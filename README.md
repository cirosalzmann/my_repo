> * Project Title: Strategies to get the most votes

Investigation (of factors influencing opinion formation) of dynamic opinion and how to effectively bring the average opinion distribution of a society/community to your advantage. 

## General Introduction

(States your motivation clearly: why is it important / interesting to solve this problem?)
(Add real-world examples, if any)
(Put the problem into a historical context, from what does it originate? Are there already some proposed solutions?)

The formation of people's opinions depends on various factors. A better understanding of those factors may lead to more effective strategies of influencing the opinions in a desired way. One notable example of when such strategies might come in handy, are elections. 
Therefore we apply our model to the presidential elections in the U.S. which is a very current but also recurring event.


## The Model

(Define dependent and independent variables you want to study. Say how you want to measure them.) (Why is your model a good abstraction of the problem you want to study?) (Are you capturing all the relevant aspects of the problem?)

dependences of the model:
-we examine a binary model (candidate A vs candidate B) whereas in real world scenarios there are often more options. Nevertheless the opinion could be restated as “do you prefer option A or option B” and suddenly it’s binary.
-the number of agents (mindsetters) for/ against
-their disposition (will two agents reach more people together, in a same area, or dispatched)
-the density of population
-the links between the members of this test-population 
-correlation between political opinions and communities
-the scale (the world/ a country/ a town/ a suburb) 

## Fundamental Questions

(At the end of the project you want to find the answer to these questions)
(Formulate a few, clear questions. Articulate them in sub-questions, from the more general to the more specific. )
Which strategies for gaining last minute support and getting out the vote are more effective than others?
How to best reach people in order to, for example, win a presidential Election?
How to reach a maximum of people?
Who should be the target individuals? Common voters or more influential people?
how fast will a community react on an foreign opinion?


## Expected Results

(What are the answers to the above questions that you expect to find before starting your research?)

Being more than one actor influencing a specific population area might work out better but being to many of those won’t probably help any longer.
